# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on making targeted UI improvements to the Hong Kong Tourism Trip Planning application. The current application is functional but has specific design issues that create visual fragmentation and layout problems. These small but important changes will create a more unified and polished user experience without requiring major architectural changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing the trip planning interface, I want the layout components to appear as a unified design rather than fragmented pieces, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the main trip planning page THEN the system SHALL display components with unified border radius styling where only the outer corners of the overall layout are rounded
2. WHEN the user sees multiple adjacent components THEN the system SHALL remove individual component rounding on internal edges to create seamless visual connections
3. WHEN the user views drag bars or dividers THEN the system SHALL style them without rounded corners to maintain visual continuity with adjacent components
4. WHEN the user observes the overall layout THEN the system SHALL present a cohesive design that appears as integrated sections rather than separate floating cards

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user resizing the interface using drag bars, I want all content to remain visible and properly laid out, so that I don't lose access to any information when adjusting the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user drags interface elements to resize sections THEN the system SHALL ensure no content is covered or hidden by overlapping components
2. WHEN the user adjusts the map size THEN the system SHALL automatically reflow the attraction details and other content to fit the available space
3. WHEN the user changes the layout dimensions THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing and prevent content from being clipped or obscured
4. WHEN the user resizes any section THEN the system SHALL update the layout calculations to ensure all elements remain accessible and visible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user interacting with drag bars, I want subtle and appropriate hover feedback, so that I know the element is interactive without the interface becoming distracting or unstable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user hovers over drag bars THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback through cursor changes and subtle color or opacity changes only
2. WHEN the user hovers over drag bars THEN the system SHALL NOT enlarge, scale, or transform the drag bar elements
3. WHEN the user moves the cursor away from drag bars THEN the system SHALL smoothly return to the default visual state
4. WHEN the user is actively dragging THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback without size changes that could interfere with the dragging action

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the responsive layout, I want the interface to adapt smoothly to different sizes, so that the experience remains consistent regardless of how I adjust the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user changes the viewport or section sizes THEN the system SHALL smoothly transition between different layout configurations
2. WHEN content needs to reflow due to size changes THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and usability of all interface elements
3. WHEN the user reaches minimum or maximum size constraints THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate visual feedback and prevent further resizing that would break the layout
4. WHEN multiple sections are being resized THEN the system SHALL coordinate the layout changes to maintain overall interface integrity
